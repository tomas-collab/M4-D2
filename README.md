# M4-D2

Create your first React App!

In this exercise you are going to create your own book store by using React Components!

Use the create-react-app boilerplate to create your new React application
Install and set up bootstrap + react-bootstrap in your app
Create a MyNav component which will render a bootstrap navigation bar with the following links: Home, About and Browse. Note: we don't know how to perform navigation yet, so for now just put "#" as the href for each one on them
Create a MyFooter component which will render a footer for the page
Create a Welcome component with a Jumbotron and a subtitle for your shop
Create a Latest Release component. This component should read from one of the json files and print out the cover of the books
Push everything on GitHub and publish on Eduflow before 17:00 CET
